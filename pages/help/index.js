                    We are committed as a matter of our organizational policy and commercial operations to app
                    accessibility for all users of this Meca App, including all users with disabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, we have committed as an integral component of our ongoing app development process and
                    policies to conformance with generally recognized and accepted guidelines and/or standards for app
                    accessibility (the "Standards"), which are currently at least the Meca app built with Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these Standards may change and/or evolve over time, it has been and continues to be our
                    express policy, which will be implemented with the additional guidance of a third-party
                    accessibility expert, to devote our resources to continually enhance the design and features of this
                    mobile app so as not to discriminate against or deny access to any disabled users of the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of our policy and ongoing commitment to app accessibility, we are making available this
                    accessibility statement and the dedicated accessibility email address below in order to address any
                    accessibility issues that individual users of this Meca app may encounter and for which they seek a
                    reasonable accommodation or auxiliary aid.
